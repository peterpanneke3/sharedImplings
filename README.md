##How it works
When a dragon or lucky impling is visible on your client, your client reports the impling to a server. (The plugin allows you to not report implings if you want to catch them yourself)
The server then tells other clients about this impling.
When you receive an impling location from the server, you will see the region and the location will be marked on the worldmap.
